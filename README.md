# Yurivania: Uhaul of the Night 🐍🌱

This is my entry to [YuriJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/yuri-game-jam-2020): an adventure game with a metroidvania style.

Players take the role of Stheno, a gorgon who is hoping her girlfriend Alraune will move in with her.
But to accomodate a plantgirl Stheno's room will need an overhaul!
Hopefully their castle community can provide everything necessary to make a comfy space for them both....

# How to Play 🧛‍♀️🏰

Right now the game is unfinished and cannot be played.  Once done, the game will be available on Itch.  Expected delivery date is *November 30th, 2020*.

# Goals 👭🕸️

I wanted to create something cute, simple, and gay over the course of the two month jam.
I liked the idea of working with a toolset I'd never used before.
I chose a system with significant technical constraints, as fewer choices mean faster development.

# Features 🎭🗺️

1. A 2D side-scrolling map that may be explored.
2. Inventory-based puzzle solving.
3. Environmental hazards to avoid.
4. Several characters to interact with.
5. A map system.
